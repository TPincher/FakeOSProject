# FakeOSProject

The project brief was to create a shallow copy of an operating system desktop, with at least three modals and a working date/time feature.

This is made to work in desktop resolutions only.


If I were to redo this project with more time, I would create it for a smaller resolution first and then use media queries to scale up, as scaling down proved difficult.
I would also not use the <dialog> element, as the closing tag was difficult to dynamically position.
